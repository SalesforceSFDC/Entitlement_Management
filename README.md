# Entitlement_Management

## Entitlements
Entitlements tell the support team which level each customer is entitled to based in their SLA.
### Process:
* You create an entitlement that entitles a particular account to phone support.
* A contact from that account calls support with a question.
* The support agent looks up the account and sees it has an active phone support entitlement.
* The agent answers the question and, if needed, creates a case from the entitlement.
#### Additional steps (i.e.):
* high-priority cases must be closed within 24 hours
* agents must respond to customer comments on cases within 4 hours

##
entitlement process -  To enforce time-dependent support steps
* Entitlement processes are customizable timelines that include all of the steps (or milestones, in Salesforce lingo) that support agents must complete to resolve a case. Once you set up a process, you can apply it to as many customer entitlements as you need.
* Entitlement template - If a product that you offer includes the same support level for every customer, attach an entitlement template
    * Youâ€™ll only use entitlement templates if you use products in your org. Salesforce developer orgs come with several predefined products for you to play around with.
